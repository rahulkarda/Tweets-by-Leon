[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs) The Twitter API enables programmatic access to Twitter in unique and advanced ways. It allows access to core elements of Twitter like: Tweets, Direct Messages, Spaces.

## Optimizations
While improve this project, I would start by implementing the following features -

   1. <s>Making it mobile responsive</s>
   2. Adding a loading bar/circle 
   
              
## Lessons Learned
I learned about the basics of API and how they can be used asynchronously to fetch data without blocking the rest of the functionalities. I learned how to integrate Twitter's API and use it to fetch the tweets. I learned about API management and how the API serves a request and how can it help in improving businesses.
